# Muscle Force

## Introduction
This repository defines a computational model for predicting the force generated by muscles under intramuscular functional electrical stimulation (FES). This model serves as a platform to optimize placement and stimulation techniques used in intramuscular electrodes are in order to overcome the limitations of skin surface FES. Skin surface FES recruits all motor units at once, which prevents the use of FES in fine motor control, rapidly fatigues muscles, and causes discomfort by recruiting sensory nerves.

Under healthy circumstances, the brain recruits motor units within muscles from smallest to largest (in terms of their maximum force generated). The distribution of slow-twitch and fast-twitch fibers differs depending on the size. Compared to the overall muscle composition, smaller motor units overrepresent fatigue-resistant slow-twitch fibers, while larger motor units overrepresent fatigue-sensitive fast-twitch fibers.

Thus, the normal biological function of recruiting motor units from smallest to largest minimizes the rate of fatigue, and enables fine motor control. **If intramuscular FES is capable of selectively recruiting motor units, especially in a manner which mimics natural motor control, then the rate of fatigue for intramuscular FES will be less than that for skin surface FES.**

## Model Components
This computational platform thus requires 4 main components:
1. A model to describe the properties of the motor units which comprise a muscle (Muscle.py)
2. A model to predict force generated by motor units as they are stimluated, and the fatigue they experience as a result (Force.py)
3. A model to generate nerve structures within muscles, allocate segments of nervous structures to motor units, and locate nodes of Ranvier (NerveTree.py)
4. A model to determine excitation of a nerve as a result of stimulation (Stimulation.py)
<!-- 5. A GUI to parameterize muscles, visualize forces, design stimulation patterns -->
